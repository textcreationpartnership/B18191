            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Brief Account, of the <hi>Nature, Vertues, Use,</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of INDIAN CATTEE.</head>
            <p>CAttee is the only true Composition of <hi>Catechu,</hi> whereof there are two sorts: The Right is treated of by <hi>John Huighen Van Linscholen,</hi> in his History of his Voyages into the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1598. <hi>Page</hi> 107. They use says he, <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Indians,</hi> a mixture made of a certain Wood or Tree, into little Rolls called <hi>Cattee,</hi> which is very good for the <hi>Maw,</hi> and against a <hi>Stinking Breath;</hi> a Soveraign Medicin for the <hi>Teeth,</hi> and fastening the <hi>Gums;</hi> very good against the <hi>Scurvey:</hi> And it is most true, that in <hi>India,</hi> very few are troubled with <hi>Stinking Breath,</hi> or <hi>Toothach, Scurvey,</hi> or any such Diseases: And <hi>Page</hi> 108. The King says he, and Lords of <hi>India,</hi> use Rolls made of <hi>Cattee, Aracca Camphir, Lignum Aloes,</hi> and <hi>Amber Greese,</hi> &amp;c. Which they continually eat mixt together.</p>
            <p>Next <hi>Schorder,</hi> and thence <hi>Salmon</hi> in his New <hi>London Dispensatory,</hi> terms it a <hi>Japonick</hi> Earth of a Purple Colour, with white Specks as if Mouldy; very sharp in Tast, melts in Chewing, leaveing a Sweetness behind it; is drying, and held in the Mouth, it dryes up all <hi>Catarrhs,</hi> and strengthens the Head.</p>
            <p>The other Common Sort, called <hi>Cashew,</hi> is of a concret hard Substance, like Old <hi>Spanish Juice</hi> of <hi>Liquorish,</hi> the which made up with Musk, into little Grains, like Mice-turds, is vended by the Name of <hi>Cashew,</hi> which (though for goodness nothing like it) many sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it to be the same as <hi>Cattee;</hi> hath obliged me to give this account of both, that <hi>Cashew</hi> may not be mistaken for <hi>Cattee,</hi> which is only there recommended as it is made up with its speciphick admixtures, after the true <hi>Indian</hi> manner (which is only known to my self) into little Rolls or Confects; whereof one or two being held in the mouth, and as it melts, swallowing down the moisture, it so strengthens and comforts the <hi>Stomach, Head, Heart, Breast,</hi> and <hi>Lungs;</hi> drys up all <hi>Rheums,</hi> helps Digestion, expels <hi>Wind,</hi> allays all <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,</hi> sweetens the <hi>Breath,</hi> and preserves the <hi>Teeth</hi> and <hi>Gums;</hi> that neither <hi>Scurvey, Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, Stinking Breath, Cough, Tissick,</hi> or such like Infirmities as are found among the <hi>Indians:</hi> whereof I have seen the Experience, as having lived more then ten Years there; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recommend the like use of it here, where such Infirmities rage so much amongst us; especially the Remedy being so delightful, pleasant, and diverting.</p>
            <p>Also, if three or four <hi>Confects</hi> be put into half a Pint of scalding hot Water, with the like Quantity of fine Sugar, as is put into so much <hi>Tea,</hi> it makes as Excellent a Drink in two or three minutes space, having all the Vertues and Properties both of <hi>Tea</hi> and <hi>Coffee.</hi> And one or two <hi>Confects</hi> put into a Pipe of <hi>Tobacca,</hi> it yields a Curious Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Smell.</p>
            <p>Wherewith all Persons may be furnished at most Principal <hi>Coffee-Houses,</hi> and Places sell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such things for One Shilling the BOX; from the Author, living in <hi>Holborn,</hi> at the <hi>Phisitians Arms</hi> over the Door, in the <hi>New-Red-Lyon-Street,</hi> against <hi>Great Turn-stile,</hi> where is his private new way of <hi>Sweating</hi> and <hi>Bathing</hi> both at once, by an Artificial <hi>Dew-Bath,</hi> without entering into <hi>Water,</hi> or Heat of <hi>Fire,</hi> or Breathing the Air, wherein the Body sweats; whereby all the prejudices happening by all other ways of <hi>Sweatings</hi> and <hi>Bathings</hi> are prevented. This being only performed by the Heat and moysture of a continued <hi>Warm Vaporous Dew,</hi> or <hi>Steem,</hi> raised from various Decoctions of all sorts of <hi>Drugs;</hi> as <hi>Herbs, Flower, Seeds, Woods, Waters, Wines,</hi> &amp;c. according to each ones Occasion; which continually Flows and Distills on the Body, dureing all the time of <hi>Sweating</hi> and <hi>Bathing;</hi> and is always Prepared anew, peculiarly for every one that uses it.</p>
